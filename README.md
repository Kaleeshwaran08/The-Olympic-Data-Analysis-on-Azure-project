# The-Olympic-Data-Analysis-on-Azure-project

An analytical and data engineering tour through the Tokyo Olympic dataset is offered by this project. Azure Data Factory is used to ingest the data into the Azure ecosystem, starting with a CSV on GitHub. First kept in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, it is subsequently converted in Azure Databricks. Once more stored in ADLS Gen2, the enriched data is subjected to sophisticated analytics in Azure Synapse. Finally, the insights are displayed in Power BI or Azure Synapse, providing a thorough overview of the dataset.
